# python-template

This project contains three essential files for running a Flask web application: `run.py`, `main.py`, and `requirements.txt`. The goal is to create and activate a virtual environment, install the required dependencies, and run the "main.py" file from that activated environment.

1. (optional) Define the virtual environment name in "run.py":

   ```
   venv_name = "environment"
   ```

2. Run server from cmd with line:

   ```
   python run.py
   ```
